# Workflow for automated tests with Angular

Automating test for Angular with a workflow requires the actual workflow (c.f. `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`), changes to the standard Karma and Protractor configurations and also some additional dependencies.


Karma and Protractor must be configured such that they test with a headless browser, or else the github actions can not execute the tests (c.f. `karma-ci.conf.js` and `e2e/protractor-ci.conf.js` ).
They use [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) for that headless browser stuff.


There are also some added scripts (`autotest` and `autoe2e`) in the package.json to simplify the actual workflow.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
